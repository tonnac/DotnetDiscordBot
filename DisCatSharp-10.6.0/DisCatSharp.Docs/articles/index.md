# How to use articles

Images used in articles might include version numbers, which may not be the latest version of DisCatSharp.

Example code should be treated as pseudo-code, and may not compile.

# Knowledge Prerequisites

Before attempting to write a Discord bot, you should be familiar with the concepts of [Object Oriented Programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [the C# programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/), and [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap).

If you're brand new to C#, or programming in general, this library may prove difficult for you to use.</br>
Fortunately, there are resources that can help you get started with the language!

An excellent tutorial series to go through would be [C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/CSharp-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners) by Bob Tabor.
His videos go through all the getting_started, from setting up your development environment up to some of the more advanced concepts.
If you're not sure what to do first, Bob's tutorial series should be your starting point!

Another great resource is Microsoft's [Introduction to C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/), which is an interactive tutorial.

# Supported .NET Implementations

# Getting Started

If you're writing a Discord bot for the first time, you'll want to start with _[creating a bot account](xref:getting_started_bot_account)_.

Otherwise, if you have a bot account already, start off with the _[writing your first bot](xref:getting_started_first_bot)_ article.

Once you're up and running, feel free to browse through the [API Documentation](xref:api_index)!
