# Lavalink Setup

## Configuring Java

In order to run Lavalink, you must have Java 17 or greater installed. For more details check the [requirements](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/tree/dev#requirements) before downloading.
The latest v17 releases can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).

Make sure the location of the newest JRE's bin folder is added to your system variable's path. This will make the `java` command run from the latest runtime. You can verify that you have the right version by entering `java -version` in your command prompt or terminal.

## Downloading Lavalink

Download the Lavalink V4 server from the [GitHub](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases/tag/4.0.0).

To use the Lavalink server, you need to configure it first.

Create a new YAML file called `application.yml`, and use the [example file](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/blob/dev/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example), or copy this snippet:

```yaml
server: # REST and WS server

#    some_key: some_value # Some key-value pair for the plugin

    frameBufferDurationMs: 5000 # How many milliseconds of audio to keep buffered
    opusEncodingQuality: 10 # Opus encoder quality. Valid values range from 0 to 10, where 10 is best quality but is the most expensive on the CPU.

YAML is whitespace-sensitive. Make sure you are using a text editor which properly handles this.


There are a few values to keep in mind.

The `host` is the IP of the Lavalink host. This will be `0.0.0.0` by default, but it should be changed as it is a security risk. For this guide, set this to `127.0.0.1` as we will be running Lavalink locally.

`port` is the allowed port for the Lavalink connection. `2333` is the default port, and is what will be used for this guide.

The `password` is the password that you will need to specify when connecting. This can be anything as long as it is a valid YAML string. Keep it as `youshallnotpass` for this guide.

When you are finished configuring this, save the file in the same directory as your Lavalink executable.

Keep note of your `port`, `address`, and `password` values, as you will need them later for connecting.

## Starting Lavalink

Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing Lavalink.

Once there, type `java -jar Lavalink.jar`. You should start seeing log output from Lavalink.

If everything is configured properly, you should see this appear somewhere in the log output without any errors:

If it does, congratulations. We are now ready to interact with it using DisCatSharp.
