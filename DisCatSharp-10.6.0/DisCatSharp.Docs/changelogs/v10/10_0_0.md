# Upgrade from **9.9.0** to **10.0.0**

## What is new in DisCatSharp?

-   Advanced dependency injection system
-   Support for API v10
-   Message content intent
-   Properly working application command localization
-   Optimized lib code
-   Pre-implementation of upcoming things
-   Support for [Channel Type](xref:DisCatSharp.Enums.ChannelType) `Forum` (WIP)

## What changed?

To get message content with API v10, you have to enable the message content intent in the developer portal AND specify the [DiscordIntent](xref:DisCatSharp.Enums.DiscordIntents) `MessageContent`.
Otherwise you won't receive message contents from guild messages where the bot isn't mentioned.

## Backwards Compatibility

You can always choose to use a previous API version.
I.e. if you want to use API V9, you can use `DiscordIntents.AllV9Less` to enable all intents that are valid for this version.
