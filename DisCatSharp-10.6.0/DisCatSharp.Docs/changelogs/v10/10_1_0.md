## Information to other [Discord Features](https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log)

-   We won't implement AutoMod for a while, as it takes a lot of time to implement and we don't have the time for it right now.
-   DiscordMember Timeout Events are still buggy, we have it on our list of bugs to fix, but it's not a priority right now.
