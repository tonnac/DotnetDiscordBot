### 10.2.0-hacktober-008

> [!WARNING]
> This version contains breaking changes

#### Note

This version adds support for user, role, channel & mentionable selects in both the main lib as well in interactivity.

```diff
- DiscordSelectComponent was removed and replaced by
+ DiscordStringSelectComponent + DiscordStringSelectComponentOption
+ Select component types have the base class DiscordBaseSelect from now on
* Interactivity for selects where changed in the InteractivityExtension, as well in the MessageExtension to have an additional required parameter before the timeout override called selectType. You need to specify for which select type you're waiting for
```
