## Username System Change

<br/>

### [Preamble](#tab/username-sys-pre)

Official resources:

-   https://dis.gd/usernames
-   https://dis.gd/app-usernames
-   https://discord.com/blog/usernames

### [The Discord Announcement](#tab/username-sys-discord)

#### Impact of Unique Usernames on Apps and Bots

Discord announced that Discord’s username system is changing. Discriminators are being removed and new, unique usernames (`@name`) and display names are being introduced. These changes will make it easier for users to connect with their friends and give more control over identity on Discord. You can visit https://discord.com/blog/usernames to hear from one of their founders about why usernames are changing, or read more details about how changes to the username system affects non-bot users at https://dis.gd/usernames.

#### More details for developers (including an FAQ) are in the Help Center article:

-   https://dis.gd/app-usernames

Below is an overview of how apps and bots will be affected by the username change. More details for developers, including exact dates, will be communicated soon.

#### Changes to bot users on Discord

1. They recently made a change to add bot users to all newly-created apps. During the username migration, all apps without a bot user created before April 14 will have a bot user automatically added. If your app doesn’t require a bot user, you can skip adding the `bot` scope during installation.

2. After migration, developers will no longer be able to directly set bot usernames or bot icons. The bot user’s icon will _always_ be the same as the App Icon. Bot usernames will be determined differently for verified and unverified apps:

-   **Verified apps**: Bot usernames will be determined by the Application Name. When an unverified app goes through the verification process, a username created from the Application Name will be given to the bot user.
-   **Unverified apps**: Bot usernames will be randomized for new and existing unverified apps. This does not affect the Application Name.

3. Application Names (the `Name` field on the **General Overview** page within the app’s settings) will be used as the Display Name for an app’s bot user. This means developers cannot manually update the Display Name for a bot user without updating the Application Name. Server nicknames are unaffected by this change.

4. The Discord client will be updated to only display Application Names in most surfaces, including the bot profile and in the search interface. The client changes will allow all Discord apps, verified and unverified, to use their Application Name as the identity for their app (and bot) across Discord.

#### Migration of verified app usernames

Most verified apps with Application Names which can be automatically migrated to the new username system have been reserved. No user will be able to claim the reserved username, and during migration the reserved name will be automatically given to the app's bot user.

Verified apps that cannot be automatically migrated or wish to change their Application Name for another reason will be able to make a one-time change at the time of migration.

#### Identifying migrated users

To keep clients backwards-compatible, users that are migrated to the new username system will have a single zero (`#0`) discriminator. This will not appear in the client, but will be in payloads your app receives. After the migration to the new username system is complete, the `0` discriminator will be removed.

#### Preparing your app for username changes

-   Remove any logic that depends on discriminators for Discord users. Apps should continue using user IDs to uniquely identify Discord users in their code. Make sure to account for the temporary `#0` discriminator that updated users will have when updating your code.
-   Be prepared for your username change. That includes in code, or anywhere else you may reference your bot username.
-   If your app is verified, stay tuned for details about migration dates and how to perform a one-time update for your Application Name/bot username.

### [DisCatSharps Info](#tab/username-sys-discatsharp)

#### Developer take on the username change for bots

Bots having `Username#Discrim` is pretty useless imo.
`Username#Discrim`s only purpose is to add friends, but you can't add bots as friends.

A single `@username` makes more sense for bots because it acts as a vanity identifier.

Now you could argue about the fact that non-verified bots usernames are randomized.
That might be true, but users see the application name anyways in the UI, and this field is changeable.
Upon verification you can choose your custom `@username`.

I think this helps fighting scams and impersionations even more.

#### Transition to global name

We've deprecated `Discriminator` & `DiscriminatorInt` on the [DiscordUser](xref:DisCatSharp.Entities.DiscordUser) & [DiscordMember](xref:DisCatSharp.Entities.DiscordMember) entities.

Due to global name not being rolled out yet, `GlobalName` is marked as experimental for now.

During the rollout we'll remove the experimental mark from `GlobalName`.

You should update to this new field as soon as possible when the rollout begins.

As an example how to handle both cases:

[!code-csharp[](../../snippets/global_name.cs?highlight=13)]

#### New, changed and deprecated fields

These changes apply both for [DiscordUser](xref:DisCatSharp.Entities.DiscordUser) & [DiscordMember](xref:DisCatSharp.Entities.DiscordMember).

| Change Type | Field or Function         | Type            | Change Description                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deprecated  | Discriminator             | @System.String  |                                                                                        |
| Deprecated  | DiscriminatorInt          | @System.Int32   |                                                                                        |
| Deprecated  | UsernameWithDiscriminator | @System.String  | This falls back to `UsernameWithGlobalName` for a while if a user is already migrated. |
| Added       | UsernameWithGlobalName    | @System.String  |                                                                                        |
| Added       | GlobalName                | @System.String  |                                                                                        |
| Added       | IsMigrated                | @System.Boolean | Helper function to detect whether a user has is enrolled in the new system.            |
| Changed     | ToString()\*              | @System.String  | Function was updated to return the correct info based on `IsMigrated`                  |

\*This was also changed for [DiscordTeamMember.ToString()](xref:DisCatSharp.Entities.DiscordTeamMember.ToString)

#### Automatic Mapping

To help you transition to this change, we automatically map the old username with discriminator to the new username with global name.

## Application Subscription

<br/>

### [Preamble](#tab/appsub-pre)

We would like to announce that we have added partial support for Discord's Premium Apps feature. However, please note that this feature is currently in alpha and may not be fully supported by our library as library developers don't get access to the documentation for it.

Premium Apps allow developers to provide premium commands for which users can subscribe via in-app purchases. If a user is not subscribed, bots will respond with a message asking them to subscribe. If they are subscribed, the command payload from Discord to the bot will have a SKU ID set, indicating that the user or server is subscribed.

Although our library has implemented support for this feature, you might need to make adjustments to your code to fully utilize it. If you encounter any issues or require assistance, please inform us so that we can address the issue within the library.

### [Premium Apps](#tab/appsub-pa)

![premium_app_popout_profile](/images/premium_app_popout_profile.png)

![premium_app_popout_description](/images/premium_app_popout_description.png)

![premium_app_app_discovery](/images/premium_app_app_discovery.png)

### [Implementation](#tab/appsub-impl)

#### DisCatSharp

We've added the field [Entitlements](xref:DisCatSharp.Entities.DiscordInteraction.Entitlements) to get the entitlements for premium apps.
It is a list of sku ids.

[InteractionResponseType](xref:DisCatSharp.Enums.InteractionResponseType) was extended by type `10` called `InteractionRequireEntitlement`. This is used to tell Discord that the user is not entitled to use the command and requests the user to buy the premium subscription.

Additionally we've added the function TryGetPublishedListings to get the published premium sku listings for an application.
You can use it to check dynamically for your sku ids.

#### DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands

Application commands got a new @System.Attribute called ApplicationCommandRequireEntitlementAttribute to require an entitlement to execute a command.

BaseContext now has the field [Entitlements](xref:DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands.Context.BaseContext.Entitlements).
